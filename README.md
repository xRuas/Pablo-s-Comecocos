# Pablo-s-Comecocos
Final Project Code In Place

A classic-style Pac-Man game built with Python and Pygame. It features:
- Arrow key movement (only moves while pressed)
- Victory condition when all dots are collected or all ghost are eated
- 3 pre-defined symmetric maps selected randomly at game start
- Simple sprite support and customizable map system

To run the game:
1. Make sure you have Python 3 and `pygame` installed (`pip install pygame`)
2. Run the script: `python pacman.py`

Feel free to edit or add new maps inside the `mapas_predefinidos()` function!
